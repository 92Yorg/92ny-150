<p class="o-lead">Under the leadership of our Chairman Jody Arnhold, 92NY has embarked on a vital &mdash; and much needed &mdash; capital campaign that will transform our campus, build our endowment and support our&nbsp; programs, allowing us to serve&nbsp; everyone in our local and global community better. Our vision is to secure our future and make our physical and digital spaces destinations that reflect 92NY&rsquo;s global reputation, excite our patrons, and serve our needs for generations to come. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our latest work on our physical space began in 2022 with the help of world-class architects Beyer Blinder Belle and our owners&rsquo;&nbsp; representatives, Lehrer Cumming. This work, which totals $25 million in new investment in this phase alone, includes the creation of The Arnhold Center, which comprises the new Arnhold Studio and the fully renovated Buttenwieser Hall and Buttenwieser Lounge. It is&nbsp; lso home to the Harkness Dance Center and the Dance Education Laboratory (DEL). The Arnhold Center encompasses the entire performance complex on the second floor of our campus&rsquo; North building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this phase, our May Center for Health, Fitness and Sport is getting a new lobby area &mdash; The Millstone Commons &mdash; along with urgently needed locker room upgrades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s next? A $70-million phase, featuring a new entrance experience for all visitors to our campus, a new space for seniors, a new performance space, and much more. &nbsp;</p>
